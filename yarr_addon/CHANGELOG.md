# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Added TV support: genre auto-add and surprise rotation against
  Sonarr, mirroring the movie feature set. Sonarr identifies shows by
  TVDB id rather than TMDB id, so candidates get their tvdb_id resolved
  via TMDB's external-ids lookup before being added. A surprise show is
  only deleted once its *last* episode is confirmed watched (checked
  live against Jellyfin's own per-series played status), not
  episode-by-episode. Entirely opt-in — set `sonarr_url`/`sonarr_api_key`
  to enable it, leave blank to stay movies-only.
- Added `learn_genres_from_library`: an alternative to hand-typing
  `genres`/`tv_genres`, deriving a weighted genre profile from your
  Jellyfin watch history (favourites and replay count weighted higher).
- Added optional read-only SABnzbd queue monitoring
  (`sabnzbd_url`/`sabnzbd_api_key`) — a status sensor and web UI card,
  never writes anything to the queue.
- One Jellyfin webhook now handles both movie and episode PlaybackStop
  events (dispatched by `ItemType`), rather than needing a second
  webhook for TV.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: TMDB-driven genre auto-add to Radarr, an automatic
  random "surprise film" rotation (tagged separately in Radarr), and a
  Jellyfin-webhook-triggered watch-and-delete loop for surprise films
  only, with a configurable grace period and a keep-it-instead toggle.
  Watch-history exclusion reads Jellyfin's own per-user played status
  directly (TMDB has no personal-account concept, so this replaced an
  earlier Trakt-based design that turned out to need a paid VIP tier
  for its recommendations API).
